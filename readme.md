# A Responsive Carousel
If there's one thing that can compete with lightboxes for “world’s most done-to-death jQuery plugin,” it’s carousels. However, everything I came across was using pixel values and not percentages—meaning I wasn’t finding much of anything that could be used on a responsive/flexible layout. So I built one.

## Aw yeah.
The new dragSnap event has been merged into the main branch—it addresses a bunch of issues, and works pretty damn well if I do say so.

## “Dynamic?” Isn’t that a little “DHTML for Dummies?”
Well, it’s not static, is it? I’m takin’ it back.
