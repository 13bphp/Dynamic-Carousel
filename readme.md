# A Responsive Carousel
If there's one thing that can compete with lightboxes for “world’s most done-to-death jQuery plugin,” it’s carousels. However, everything I came across was using pixel values and not percentages—meaning I wasn’t finding much of anything that could be used on a responsive/flexible layout. So I built one.

Shout-out to <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl">Scott Jehl</a> for the adapted swipe events from jQuery Mobile. 

## Coming Soon

- I’m working a touch-and-drag plugin that more closely mimics native behavior, so the slider would follow your finger as you dragged left and right over it, and once released snap to the next/previous slide depending on the drag distance.
- People keep asking if I’m planning on adding an auto-advance dealie to this. Now, as much as I am generally opposed to having stuff flying all over the screen without the end user’s say-so, well, shucks: you know I just can’t say no to you, Internet. One setInterval, comin’ right up (soonish).
- More M\*A\*S\*H references in commit messages.
